title = "Lucy's Tidal Course"
+++

This is an example resource. Here are some materials Lucy created for a multi-part tidal course. 

There are some more bits and pieces that need to be added for context.

And we need to think about the best way to organise material like this.

You can download the .tidal files or copy and paste the code into Atom (or whatever text editor you're using)
