All participants at Pattern Club events, including attendees,
performers, organisers and volunteers, are required to agree with the
following code of conduct. Please support it and help ensure a safe
environment for everybody.

## What Is This?

To meet our aim to make inclusive, safe events, we have outlined
expectations of participants. This code applies to Pattern Club, any
related social events and online communities around it. For more
information on codes of conduct and why they are necessary, see
http://www.ashedryden.com/blog/codes-of-conduct-101-faq

## The Short Version

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. This
applies both in person or via online media.

## The Less Short Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability,
physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology
choices, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, disruption of
performances, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
attention.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
or have any other concerns, please contact an organiser
immediately. Pattern Club organisers will try to be present at all
times - additionally, venue staff (where possible/appropriate) will be
briefed on this code and can act on the organisers behalf.

If you report an incident of harassment to Pattern Club organisers you
can expect to be listened to and taken seriously. They will take
action they deem appropriate in response depending on the scale and
severity of the incident.  For example:

* Discuss the perpetrator's behaviour with them and ask them to stop.
  Explain what they have done and why it is unacceptable.  Remind the
  perpetrator of the code of conduct.  Monitor the perpetratorâ€™s
  behaviour and if it improves then they will continue to be welcome
  at events.
* Eject the perpetrator from the event.  Explain what they have done
  and why it is unacceptable and remind them of the code of conduct.
  Monitor the person's behaviour at future events and if it improves
  then they will continue to be welcome.
* Eject the perpetrator from the event and ban them from future
  events.  Explain what they have done and why it is unacceptable and
  remind them of the code of conduct.

Pattern Club organisers and venue staff will be happy to help
participants contact security or police, or otherwise assist those
experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event and
their journey home.
